Gonorrhea and chlamydia often show no symptoms, leading to untreated infections and complications like infertility. Dual testing (urine/swab) is key. Both are treatable with antibiotics, but drug-resistant gonorrhea is rising. Prevention includes condoms and reducing partner numbers. Retesting post-treatment ensures cure. Partners must be notified and treated to prevent reinfection. Annual screenings are advised for sexually active individuals under 25.
