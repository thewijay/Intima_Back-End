Polyamorous relationships require proactive STI strategies:

Regular testing for all partners.

Transparent communication about new sexual connections.

Agreed-upon boundaries (e.g., condom use with external partners).
Group testing events and shared digital health records simplify management. Ethical non-monogamy communities often prioritize collective responsibility.
