Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the healthcare industry by enabling faster diagnoses, personalized treatments, and improved patient outcomes. Machine learning algorithms can analyze large datasets to identify patterns that humans might miss, leading to more accurate predictions and better decision-making.

Some common applications of AI in healthcare include:
- Medical image analysis
- Predictive analytics for patient monitoring
- Natural language processing for electronic health records
- Drug discovery and development

As AI continues to evolve, its impact on healthcare is expected to grow, making it an essential tool for clinicians and researchers alike.
