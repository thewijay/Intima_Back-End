Fitness influencers increasingly promote sexual health by partnering with clinics to share STI testing reminders or PrEP information. Gym-themed campaigns (e.g., “Protect Your Gains, Get Tested”) resonate with young adults. Social media challenges, like #SafeSexSelfie, normalize condom use. Influencers disclose personal STI experiences to combat shame.
