Travel increases STI risks due to casual partnerships and inconsistent condom use. “Sex tourism” hotspots report high antibiotic-resistant infections. Before traveling, research local STI trends and pack condoms. Post-travel testing is advised, especially after unprotected encounters. Vaccinate against hepatitis A/B and HPV. Cruise ships and resorts can partner with health organizations to offer discreet testing.
