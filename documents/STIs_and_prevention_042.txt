Healthcare providers play a key role in STI prevention. They offer confidential testing, prescribe PrEP/PEP, and educate patients on safer sex practices. Routine screenings during checkups catch asymptomatic infections. Culturally sensitive care reduces disparities for marginalized groups. Providers also address mental health tied to STI diagnoses. Training in nonjudgmental communication ensures patients feel safe disclosing risks. Clinics can partner with schools to expand youth outreach.
