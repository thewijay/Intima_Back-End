Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections passed from one person to another through sexual contact. Common STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV. Many STIs are treatable, and some are curable. Regular testing, safe sex practices, and prompt treatment are key to managing and preventing STIs.
