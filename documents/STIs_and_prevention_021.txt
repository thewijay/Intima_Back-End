Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) spread through unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Common STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV. Prevention starts with consistent condom use, which reduces transmission risk by 98%. Regular STI testing is critical, especially for sexually active individuals. Open communication with partners about sexual health and testing history also minimizes risk. Abstinence and mutual monogamy with an uninfected partner are additional effective strategies. Vaccines, like HPV and hepatitis B vaccines, offer protection against specific STIs.
