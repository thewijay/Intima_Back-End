Topic 7: Use of condoms in STI prevention
Some STIs like HPV and Hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination. STIs often show no symptoms, so testing is the only way to be sure. Using condoms consistently and correctly greatly reduces the risk of STIs. Abstinence is the only method that guarantees complete protection from STIs. Early detection and treatment of STIs help avoid long-term complications. Getting tested regularly helps detect STIs early and prevents further spread.
