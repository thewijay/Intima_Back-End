Topic 14: How STIs are transmitted
It's important to have open conversations with partners about STI status. Early detection and treatment of STIs help avoid long-term complications. Getting tested regularly helps detect STIs early and prevents further spread. Some STIs like HPV and Hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination. Limiting the number of sexual partners reduces the risk of STIs. STIs often show no symptoms, so testing is the only way to be sure.
