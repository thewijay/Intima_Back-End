NGOs like PEPFAR and The Global Fund distribute billions of condoms and fund HIV/STI programs in 100+ countries. They train local healthcare workers, subsidize antiretrovirals, and advocate for policy changes. Grassroots NGOs address region-specific barriers, such as gender-based violence or drug criminalization.
