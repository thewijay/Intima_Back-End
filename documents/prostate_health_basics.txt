The prostate is a gland in men that plays a role in reproductive health. Common prostate issues include benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, and prostate cancer. Symptoms such as difficulty urinating, pain during urination, or frequent urination should prompt a consultation with a healthcare provider. Regular screenings are recommended for men over 50.
