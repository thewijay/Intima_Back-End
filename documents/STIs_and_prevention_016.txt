Topic 16: Importance of regular testing
Getting tested regularly helps detect STIs early and prevents further spread. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can affect anyone who is sexually active. STIs often show no symptoms, so testing is the only way to be sure. Using condoms consistently and correctly greatly reduces the risk of STIs. It's important to have open conversations with partners about STI status. Antibiotics can treat many bacterial STIs, but viral ones need lifelong care.
