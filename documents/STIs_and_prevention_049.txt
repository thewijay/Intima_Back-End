Oral sex transmits gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and herpes. Symptoms include sore throat or mouth sores. Use dental dams or condoms during oral-vaginal/anal contact. Rinsing mouths post-oral sex lacks evidence for prevention. Regular throat swab testing is advised for sexually active individuals. Openly discuss oral sex risks with partners.
