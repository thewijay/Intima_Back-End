Hepatitis B and C can spread sexually, especially through unprotected anal sex or blood contact. Hepatitis B vaccines are 95% effective, but no vaccine exists for hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis can lead to liver damage or cancer. Use condoms and avoid sharing razors/needles. Antiviral drugs treat hepatitis B/C, though C is curable. Testing is critical for those with multiple partners or injection drug use.
