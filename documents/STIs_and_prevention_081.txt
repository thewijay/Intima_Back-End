Mental health support is critical post-STI diagnosis. Anxiety or depression may follow due to stigma or fear of rejection. Counseling services integrated into STI clinics improve emotional well-being and treatment adherence. Online therapy platforms offer discreet support. Peer-led groups, like herpes support networks, reduce isolation. Addressing mental health alongside physical care fosters holistic recovery.
