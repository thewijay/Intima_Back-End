Topic 19: Communication with partners about STIs
Getting tested regularly helps detect STIs early and prevents further spread. Some STIs like HPV and Hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination. Limiting the number of sexual partners reduces the risk of STIs. It's important to have open conversations with partners about STI status. Using condoms consistently and correctly greatly reduces the risk of STIs. Antibiotics can treat many bacterial STIs, but viral ones need lifelong care.
