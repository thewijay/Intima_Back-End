Bacterial STIs (e.g., chlamydia, syphilis) are curable with antibiotics. Viral STIs (e.g., HIV, herpes) are manageable but incurable. Completing antibiotic courses for bacterial infections prevents resistance. Antivirals like acyclovir suppress herpes outbreaks. Untreated bacterial STIs increase HIV susceptibility. Partner treatment is essential for bacterial STIs to avoid “ping-pong” reinfection. Distinguishing between bacterial/viral guides treatment and prevention strategies.
