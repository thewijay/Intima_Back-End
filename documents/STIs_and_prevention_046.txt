Contact tracing identifies and notifies partners of STI exposure while maintaining confidentiality. Health departments use interviews or digital tools to alert partners anonymously. Successful tracing reduces reinfections and outbreaks. Ethical challenges include balancing privacy and public health. Training staff in trauma-informed approaches improves cooperation. Syphilis and HIV programs often prioritize tracing.
