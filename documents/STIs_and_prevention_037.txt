Antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea (“super gonorrhea”) complicates treatment. Resistance arises from antibiotic misuse or incomplete treatment. Use condoms to reduce transmission risk. Follow CDC guidelines: dual therapy (ceftriaxone + azithromycin) is standard. Report persistent symptoms immediately. Research into new antibiotics and vaccines is ongoing. Global surveillance tracks resistant strains.
