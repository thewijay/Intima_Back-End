Chronic hepatitis B and HIV co-infections accelerate liver damage. Regular liver function tests and antivirals (e.g., tenofovir) manage progression. Co-infected individuals should avoid alcohol and receive hepatitis A vaccines. Undetectable HIV viral loads donâ€™t eliminate hepatitis transmission risks. Integrated care models address overlapping health needs.
