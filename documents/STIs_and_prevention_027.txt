Trichomoniasis, a parasitic STI, often causes itching and discharge. Metronidazole treats it effectively. Untreated trichomoniasis increases HIV susceptibility. Prevention involves condom use and avoiding douching, which disrupts protective vaginal flora. Partners must be treated simultaneously to prevent reinfection. Routine screening isnâ€™t standard, so symptom reporting is critical. Asymptomatic carriers can still transmit the infection.
