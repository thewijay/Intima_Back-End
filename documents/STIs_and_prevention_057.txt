Sex workers face elevated STI risks due to client pressure for unprotected services. Empowerment through condom negotiation training and peer support reduces harm. Decriminalization improves access to healthcare and legal protections. Clinics offering nonjudgmental care and after-hours testing better serve this population. Global networks like NSWP advocate for sex workersâ€™ health rights.
