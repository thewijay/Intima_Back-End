LGBTQ+ communities face unique STI risks, such as higher HIV rates among gay/bisexual men. Tailored prevention includes PrEP uptake campaigns and anal Pap smears for HPV. Trans-inclusive care ensures hormone therapy doesnâ€™t conflict with STI treatments. Community clinics offer judgment-free testing and partner notification apps. Advocacy addresses stigma and promotes U=U (Undetectable=Untransmittable) messaging for HIV-positive individuals.
