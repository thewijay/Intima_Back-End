Follow-up care after an STI diagnosis ensures treatment success. Patients should abstain from sex until cleared, complete all medications, and return for retesting. Documented reinfections may signal partner noncompliance or undisclosed risks. Automated reminders via text/email improve follow-up rates. Mental health check-ins address post-diagnosis anxiety.
