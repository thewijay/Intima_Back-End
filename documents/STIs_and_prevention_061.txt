Innovations in STI testing include self-collection kits for chlamydia and gonorrhea, approved for at-home use. Rapid HIV tests deliver results in 20 minutes via oral swabs. Molecular testing (NAATs) improves accuracy for low-load infections. Researchers are exploring AI-driven symptom checkers to guide testing needs. These advances increase accessibility, especially for rural or privacy-conscious individuals. However, confirmatory lab tests remain essential for home kit positives.
