Climate change impacts STI transmission through displaced populations and disrupted healthcare. Natural disasters increase sexual violence and reduce access to condoms/testing. Warming temperatures may expand habitats for disease vectors (e.g., syphilis-carrying insects). Strengthening health systems in climate-vulnerable regions mitigates outbreaks.
