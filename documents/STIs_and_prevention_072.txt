Probiotics, particularly Lactobacillus strains, support vaginal health by maintaining acidic pH, which deters bacterial STIs like chlamydia. While not a standalone prevention method, probiotics may reduce infection risk when combined with condoms. Research on oral probiotics for rectal health is ongoing. Consult healthcare providers before using supplements, especially during antibiotic treatments for STIs.
