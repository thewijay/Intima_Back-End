Public health campaigns like STI Awareness Month (April) and National Condom Week promote prevention. Campaigns use social media, posters, and events to destigmatize testing and educate about PrEP/PEP. Targeted messaging for high-risk groups (e.g., LGBTQ+ youth) improves reach. Free testing drives and condom distribution programs amplify access. Global initiatives, like WHOâ€™s STI eradication goals, prioritize syphilis and HIV elimination. Grassroots efforts, including peer education, foster community trust.
