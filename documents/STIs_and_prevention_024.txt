HPV (human papillomavirus) causes genital warts and cancers. The HPV vaccine is recommended for ages 9–45, protecting against high-risk strains. Even vaccinated individuals should use condoms, as the vaccine doesn’t cover all HPV types. Regular Pap smears and HPV tests help detect cervical abnormalities early. Limiting sexual partners reduces exposure risk. Most HPV infections clear naturally, but persistent ones require monitoring.
