Incarcerated populations face disproportionately high STI rates due to limited prevention resources and healthcare access. Jails and prisons often lack condom distribution or testing programs. Education about STIs and safe practices is critical, but stigma and privacy concerns persist. Post-release linkage to community clinics improves continuity of care. Advocacy groups push for humane STI policies in correctional facilities, including vaccination programs (e.g., hepatitis B) and trauma-informed care. Reducing transmission in these settings benefits public health overall.
