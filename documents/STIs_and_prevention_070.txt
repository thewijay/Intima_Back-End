STIs like HIV and syphilis weaken immune responses, increasing vulnerability to secondary infections (e.g., tuberculosis). Chronic inflammation from untreated STIs elevates cardiovascular risks. Immune-suppressed individuals (e.g., organ transplant recipients) require rigorous STI screening. Strengthening immunity through vaccines (HPV, hepatitis B) and healthy lifestyles mitigates complications.
