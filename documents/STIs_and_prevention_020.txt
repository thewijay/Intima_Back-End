Topic 20: STI treatment options
STIs often show no symptoms, so testing is the only way to be sure. Limiting the number of sexual partners reduces the risk of STIs. Getting tested regularly helps detect STIs early and prevents further spread. Using condoms consistently and correctly greatly reduces the risk of STIs. Antibiotics can treat many bacterial STIs, but viral ones need lifelong care.
