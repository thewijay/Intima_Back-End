Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT) allows providers to prescribe STI treatment to a patient’s partner without an exam. Used for chlamydia and gonorrhea, EPT reduces reinfection rates when partners can’t access care. Legal in most U.S. states, EPT requires clear dosing instructions and allergy checks. Ethical debates focus on liability and missed diagnosis opportunities. Public health agencies promote EPT as a cost-effective outbreak control tool.
