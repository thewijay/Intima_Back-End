Mpox (formerly monkeypox) spreads via close contact, including sexual activity. Symptoms include rash, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. Vaccination (JYNNEOS) is recommended for high-risk groups. Avoid skin-to-skin contact with infected individuals or contaminated objects. Isolate until lesions heal. Condoms may reduce but not eliminate risk, as mpox spreads through direct lesion contact.
