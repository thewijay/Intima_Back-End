Asymptomatic STIs (e.g., 70% of chlamydia cases) silently damage reproductive health. Regular screening catches infections without symptoms. Untreated chlamydia/gonorrhea cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or infertility. HIV may show no symptoms for years. Encourage testing regardless of symptom presence. Assume partners may be asymptomatic; mutual testing builds trust.
