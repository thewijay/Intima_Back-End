STI stigma discourages testing and treatment. Myths (e.g., “only promiscuous people get STIs”) fuel shame. Normalize conversations by framing STIs as common health issues, not moral failures. Healthcare providers should offer nonjudgmental care. Media campaigns showcasing diverse stories reduce stigma. Support groups help individuals cope emotionally. Reducing stigma improves public health by increasing testing rates.
