Title: Understanding Menstrual Cycles

The menstrual cycle is a natural process that occurs in women of reproductive age. It typically lasts between 21 and 35 days. The cycle is divided into four phases: menstruation, the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase. Hormonal changes regulate the cycle and prepare the body for pregnancy. Tracking menstrual cycles can help identify irregularities or potential health issues such as PCOS or hormonal imbalances.
