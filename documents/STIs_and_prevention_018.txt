Topic 18: Vaccinations against STIs
Getting tested regularly helps detect STIs early and prevents further spread. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can affect anyone who is sexually active. Some STIs like HPV and Hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination. Early detection and treatment of STIs help avoid long-term complications. Antibiotics can treat many bacterial STIs, but viral ones need lifelong care.
