Anal sex carries high STI risk due to delicate tissue. Condoms and water-based lubricants prevent tears. Screen for HPV-related anal cancers in high-risk groups (e.g., men who have sex with men). Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is critical after condomless anal sex with HIV-positive partners. Regular testing is advised for receptive partners.
