HIV prevention includes pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a daily pill for high-risk individuals. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can prevent HIV after potential exposure if taken within 72 hours. Condoms remain essential for blocking HIV and other STIs. Avoid sharing needles; use sterile equipment for injections. Early HIV diagnosis through testing ensures timely treatment, improving health outcomes and reducing transmission. Education about HIV transmission myths (e.g., casual contact) is vital to combat stigma.
