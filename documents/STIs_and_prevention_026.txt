Herpes (HSV-1/HSV-2) causes oral/genital sores and spreads via skin-to-skin contact. Antiviral medications reduce outbreaks and transmission risk. Condoms/dental dams lower but donâ€™t eliminate risk, as herpes spreads from asymptomatic shedding. Avoid sexual contact during outbreaks. Disclosing herpes status to partners fosters informed decisions. Neonatal herpes, though rare, can be severe, requiring cesarean delivery if active lesions are present.
