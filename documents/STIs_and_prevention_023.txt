Syphilis progresses in stages: primary (sores), secondary (rash), latent, and tertiary (organ damage). Early detection via blood tests allows treatment with penicillin. Untreated syphilis increases HIV risk and can cause pregnancy complications. Prevent syphilis by using condoms/dental dams and avoiding skin-to-sore contact. Partner notification and treatment are crucial to curb outbreaks. Pregnant individuals should undergo syphilis screening to prevent congenital transmission.
