PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) for HIV involves daily pills (Truvada/Descovy) or injectables (Apretude). Itâ€™s 99% effective when taken consistently. PrEP users require quarterly HIV/STI testing and kidney function monitoring. Side effects (nausea, headaches) usually subside. PrEP access programs target high-risk groups, including serodiscordant couples and sex workers.
