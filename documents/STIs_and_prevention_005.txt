Topic 5: Preventive methods for STIs
STIs often show no symptoms, so testing is the only way to be sure. Getting tested regularly helps detect STIs early and prevents further spread. Some STIs like HPV and Hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination. Using condoms consistently and correctly greatly reduces the risk of STIs. Abstinence is the only method that guarantees complete protection from STIs.
