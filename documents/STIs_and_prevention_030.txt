STI prevention education should address youth, LGBTQ+ communities, and marginalized groups disproportionately affected. Comprehensive sex education reduces risky behaviors by teaching consent, contraception, and testing. Destigmatizing STIs encourages testing and treatment. Schools, clinics, and online platforms can disseminate accurate information. Community-led initiatives foster trust and culturally sensitive outreach. Policy changes, like improving access to free condoms and PrEP, enhance public health outcomes.
