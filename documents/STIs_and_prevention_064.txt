Female condoms, made of nitrile, protect against STIs and pregnancy. Theyâ€™re insertable vaginally/anally and provide broader coverage than male condoms. Though less accessible, they empower receptive partners to control protection. Proper use requires lubrication and alignment training. Public health campaigns in sub-Saharan Africa have increased adoption through subsidized distribution.
