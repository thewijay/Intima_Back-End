STI diagnoses can trigger anxiety, depression, or shame. Counseling helps patients cope and adhere to treatment. Support groups reduce isolation (e.g., herpes forums). Mental health screenings in STI clinics address dual needs. Destigmatizing language (“living with HIV” vs. “HIV-positive”) promotes resilience. Partnerships with therapists improve holistic care.
