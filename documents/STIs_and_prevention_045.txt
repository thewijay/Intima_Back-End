Untreated STIs cause severe complications:

Chlamydia/gonorrhea → pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) → infertility.

Syphilis → nerve/organ damage.

HPV → cervical/anal cancers.

HIV → AIDS without treatment.
Chronic hepatitis B/C → liver failure.
Regular testing and prompt treatment prevent progression. Public messaging should emphasize long-term health, not just infection risks.
