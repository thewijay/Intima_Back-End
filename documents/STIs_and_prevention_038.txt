STIs during pregnancy can cause miscarriage, preterm birth, or neonatal infections. Screen for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B, and chlamydia prenatally. Treat infections promptlyâ€”penicillin for syphilis, antivirals for HIV. Avoid vaginal delivery if active herpes lesions are present. Breastfeeding is safe with most STIs except HIV. Prenatal education reduces transmission risks.
