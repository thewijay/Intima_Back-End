Menstrual irregularities can refer to a variety of conditions including missed periods, infrequent periods, frequent periods, or excessively heavy or light bleeding. These irregularities can be caused by stress, hormonal imbalances, thyroid disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or other underlying health issues. A healthcare provider can help determine the cause through blood tests, ultrasounds, and other diagnostic tools.
