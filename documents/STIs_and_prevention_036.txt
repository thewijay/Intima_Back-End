Contraception ≠ STI prevention. Birth control pills, IUDs, and implants prevent pregnancy but not infections. Dual protection (condoms + hormonal contraception) is ideal. Dental dams protect during oral sex. Emergency contraception (Plan B) doesn’t guard against STIs. Educate adolescents about dual methods to prevent unintended pregnancy and infections.
