STI testing methods vary by infection. Blood tests detect HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis. Urine or swab samples identify chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis. Many clinics offer rapid HIV/hepatitis tests with results in minutes. Home testing kits are available for privacy. Testing frequency depends on risk factors: annually for sexually active individuals or after new partners. Free/low-cost testing is often accessible at public health clinics. Early diagnosis prevents complications and transmission.
