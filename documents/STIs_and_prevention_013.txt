Topic 13: Symptoms of STIs
It's important to have open conversations with partners about STI status. Antibiotics can treat many bacterial STIs, but viral ones need lifelong care. Some STIs like HPV and Hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination. Getting tested regularly helps detect STIs early and prevents further spread. Limiting the number of sexual partners reduces the risk of STIs.
