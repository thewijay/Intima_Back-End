Pubic lice (“crabs”) infest hair follicles, causing itching. Treatment includes medicated shampoos or creams. Avoid sharing towels, clothing, or bedding. Shaving pubic hair doesn’t prevent lice, as they cling to skin. Sexual partners should be treated simultaneously. Non-sexual transmission is possible but less common. Wash fabrics in hot water to eliminate lice.
