Topic 6: Importance of regular testing
Using condoms consistently and correctly greatly reduces the risk of STIs. Antibiotics can treat many bacterial STIs, but viral ones need lifelong care. Getting tested regularly helps detect STIs early and prevents further spread. Early detection and treatment of STIs help avoid long-term complications. It's important to have open conversations with partners about STI status. STIs often show no symptoms, so testing is the only way to be sure.
