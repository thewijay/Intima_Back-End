STIs in adults over 50 are rising due to divorce, dating apps, and lack of education. Ageist myths (e.g., “seniors don’t need condoms”) increase risk. Post-menopausal women face thinner vaginal tissue, elevating HIV susceptibility. Healthcare providers should discuss sexual health during routine senior care. Campaigns like “Safe Sex Never Gets Old” raise awareness.
