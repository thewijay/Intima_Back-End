Alcohol and drugs impair judgment, increasing unprotected sex or needle-sharing risks. Party drugs (e.g., methamphetamine) heighten libido and risky behaviors. Harm reduction includes carrying condoms, using clean needles, and designating a sober friend. Addiction treatment programs reduce STI transmission long-term. Nightlife venues can distribute prevention kits. Education on substance useâ€™s link to STIs is critical for adolescents.
