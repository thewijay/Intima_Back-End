Topic 1: What are STIs?
Using condoms consistently and correctly greatly reduces the risk of STIs. Some STIs like HPV and Hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination. Antibiotics can treat many bacterial STIs, but viral ones need lifelong care. Limiting the number of sexual partners reduces the risk of STIs. Abstinence is the only method that guarantees complete protection from STIs. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can affect anyone who is sexually active.
